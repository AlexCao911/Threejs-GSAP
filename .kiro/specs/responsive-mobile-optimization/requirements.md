# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical user experience issues in the my-project website related to responsive design and mobile optimization. The current implementation has layout problems when browser windows are resized to specific aspect ratios, causing component overlap and misalignment in the Showcase and Performance sections. Additionally, the Product Viewer's Canvas component lacks proper mobile gesture support, and the overall mobile loading performance is suboptimal.

The goal is to enhance the responsive behavior across all viewport sizes, implement proper mobile touch gestures for the 3D viewer, and optimize mobile loading performance to deliver a seamless experience across all devices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Showcase Section Responsive Layout

**User Story:** As a user browsing the website on various screen sizes, I want the Showcase section to maintain proper layout without overlapping or misalignment, so that I can view all content clearly regardless of my viewport dimensions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the browser window is resized to any aspect ratio THEN the Showcase section SHALL maintain proper spacing between video, mask, content, and performance stats without overlap
2. WHEN viewing on tablet devices (768px - 1024px) THEN the content wrapper SHALL adjust padding and max-widths to prevent text overflow
3. WHEN viewing on mobile devices (< 768px) THEN the layout SHALL stack vertically with appropriate spacing
4. WHEN GSAP animations are triggered on resize THEN ScrollTrigger SHALL recalculate positions using invalidateOnRefresh
5. IF the viewport width is between breakpoints THEN the layout SHALL use fluid sizing with clamp() or container queries

### Requirement 2: Fix Performance Section Responsive Layout

**User Story:** As a user exploring the Performance section, I want images and text to remain properly positioned at all viewport sizes, so that the visual presentation maintains its intended design.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the browser window is resized THEN performance images SHALL reposition smoothly without overlapping or breaking out of bounds
2. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN images SHALL either stack vertically or use a simplified layout instead of absolute positioning
3. WHEN GSAP animations calculate image positions THEN they SHALL use viewport-relative units that adapt to container dimensions
4. WHEN the section is viewed at intermediate breakpoints (e.g., 900px, 1200px) THEN the image positioning configuration SHALL interpolate smoothly
5. IF images overlap at specific aspect ratios THEN z-index and positioning logic SHALL be adjusted to maintain visual hierarchy

### Requirement 3: Implement Mobile Touch Gestures for Product Viewer

**User Story:** As a mobile user interacting with the Product Viewer, I want intuitive touch gestures to rotate and explore the 3D model, so that I can examine the product from different angles naturally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user performs a single-finger swipe on mobile THEN the 3D model SHALL rotate horizontally and vertically following the gesture
2. WHEN a user performs a pinch gesture THEN the model SHALL zoom in/out within defined limits
3. WHEN touch interaction begins THEN the system SHALL prevent default scroll behavior on the canvas element only
4. WHEN the user lifts their finger THEN the model SHALL have smooth momentum/inertia decay
5. IF OrbitControls is used THEN it SHALL be configured with touch-optimized settings (enableDamping, dampingFactor, rotateSpeed)
6. WHEN gestures are active THEN visual feedback SHALL indicate the model is interactive

### Requirement 4: Optimize Mobile Loading Performance

**User Story:** As a mobile user visiting the website, I want fast initial load times and smooth interactions, so that I can access content quickly without frustration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads on mobile THEN critical CSS and JavaScript SHALL be prioritized and non-critical resources deferred
2. WHEN 3D models are loaded THEN they SHALL use progressive loading or lower-poly versions for mobile devices
3. WHEN videos are loaded on mobile THEN they SHALL use appropriate compression and resolution (e.g., 720p instead of 4K)
4. WHEN images are requested THEN they SHALL be served in modern formats (WebP, AVIF) with appropriate sizes for mobile viewports
5. IF the device has a slow connection THEN lazy loading SHALL be implemented for below-the-fold content
6. WHEN GSAP animations initialize THEN they SHALL be conditionally loaded or simplified on low-end mobile devices
7. WHEN the Canvas component renders THEN it SHALL use performance optimizations (reduced pixel ratio, simplified materials on mobile)

### Requirement 5: Implement Comprehensive Breakpoint System

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want a consistent breakpoint system across all components, so that responsive behavior is predictable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN breakpoints are defined THEN they SHALL be centralized in a configuration file or constants
2. WHEN components check viewport size THEN they SHALL use the standardized breakpoint values
3. WHEN new responsive features are added THEN they SHALL follow the established breakpoint conventions
4. IF breakpoints need adjustment THEN changes SHALL propagate consistently across all components
5. WHEN using react-responsive THEN breakpoint queries SHALL match CSS media query breakpoints exactly

### Requirement 6: Add Viewport Resize Handling

**User Story:** As a user resizing my browser window or rotating my device, I want the layout to adapt smoothly in real-time, so that the experience remains consistent during viewport changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the viewport is resized THEN GSAP ScrollTrigger instances SHALL refresh and recalculate
2. WHEN device orientation changes THEN the layout SHALL adapt within 300ms
3. WHEN resize events occur rapidly THEN they SHALL be debounced to prevent performance issues
4. WHEN animations are recalculated THEN there SHALL be no visual jumps or layout shifts
5. IF the resize crosses a breakpoint threshold THEN component state SHALL update to reflect the new viewport category
